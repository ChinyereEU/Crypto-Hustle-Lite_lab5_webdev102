# Crypto-Hustle-Lite_lab5_webdev102

Developed an app that displays information about cryptocurrencies: their value, market cap, and percent change in value. These attributes are accessed using API calls.
Implemented a search bar that allows users to search for a specific currency.
User can view >=30 cryptocurrencies including the image, name and prie of the coin in US dollars.
User can search for a specific coin in the list of cryptocurrencies by symbol and can view a list of cryptocurrency scams on a separate pane in the page.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
